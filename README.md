# NeoMatrix_App

This app connects a web application to the arduino uno and the adafruit neopixel matrix using a built API.
The API sends a JSON response including variables that will be accessed by the arduino and printed to the neopixels. 

This was a fun project that incldued us learning more about working with Arduino, C++ and microcontrollers.
